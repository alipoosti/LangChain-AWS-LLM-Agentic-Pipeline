**Polynomial Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Deep Neural Networks in the Hard-Label Setting**
======================================================================

**Abstract**
--------

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are valuable assets, yet their public accessibility raises security concerns about parameter extraction by malicious actors. This paper introduces new techniques that achieve cryptanalytic extraction of DNN parameters in the most challenging hard-label setting, using both a polynomial number of queries and polynomial time.

**Introduction**
------------

### Focus

The paper focuses on cryptanalytic extraction of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the hard-label setting, where only the final classification label is accessible to the attacker.

### Pain Points

Previous attacks on DNNs have relied on the availability of exact numeric values of output logits, which is not always possible. Existing attacks in the hard-label setting require an exponential number of queries or have limited applicability to small networks.

### Importance

The security of DNNs is crucial, as they are valuable assets that can be exploited by malicious actors. The ability to extract DNN parameters can have significant consequences, including intellectual property theft and unauthorized use.

### Author Contributions

The authors introduce new techniques that achieve cryptanalytic extraction of DNN parameters in the hard-label setting using a polynomial number of queries and polynomial time. They propose a novel approach that analyzes the geometric shape of the decision boundary to recover all the DNN's secret parameters.

**Methodology**
-------------

The authors propose two new polynomial-time algorithms: one for recovering critical hyperplanes and another for sign recovery in the hard-label scenario. They leverage dual points to identify critical neurons and recover the architecture and parameters of the target network.

**Conclusion**
------------

### Concluding Remarks

The paper presents a cryptanalytic approach to extract deep neural networks, demonstrating the feasibility of reconstructing neural networks from their outputs.

### Remaining Open Problems

* **Scalability:** Developing more efficient methods to reduce the number of required dual points is essential.
* **Robustness:** The method's robustness against various types of noise, adversarial attacks, or model modifications needs to be investigated.
* **Applicability:** The approach is currently limited to fully connected neural networks with ReLU activations. Extending the method to other architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, and activation functions is necessary.

### Interesting Future Research Areas

* **Improving Efficiency:** Developing more efficient algorithms to reduce the computational cost of dual point exploration and neural network reconstruction.
* **Robustness and Security:** Investigating the robustness of the proposed method against various types of attacks and developing countermeasures to prevent unauthorized neural network extraction.
* **Applicability and Generalizability:** Extending the approach to other neural network architectures, activation functions, and domains, such as computer vision or natural language processing.
* **Theoretical Foundations:** Establishing a theoretical foundation for the proposed method, including bounds on the number of required dual points and the accuracy of the reconstructed neural network.
